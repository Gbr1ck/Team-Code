  I’m mostly interested in how to present myself in a professional online environment, especially to an audience or employers. Although I do have a slight existing online presence, doing so in a true professional sense is something I feel I have a lot to understand. However, in a more personal sense, I’m very much looking forward to the philosophical aspects of this course, and am highly anticipating hearing the viewpoints of my peers and participating myself in in-class discussions. New perspectives on philosophical things are very engaging to me.</div>
