  <p>I have experience with HTML, CSS, and Wordpress working on a web support team on campus, but I look forward to expanding on this experience in this class with things like AWS and bootstrap. This class is also good for me because I primarily focus on fixing other people's websites and pre-existing code so I don't have a lot of experience in creating my own web content.</p></div>
  <div class="column" style="background-color:#bbb;"><h3>Colvin Bateman</h3>
  <img src="images/Colvin.jpg">
  <p>I’m mostly interested in how to present myself in a professional online environment, especially to an audience or employers. Although I do have a slight existing online presence, doing so in a true professional sense is something I feel I have a lot to understand. However, in a more personal sense, I’m very much looking forward to the philosophical aspects of this course, and am highly anticipating hearing the viewpoints of my peers and participating myself in in-class discussions. New perspectives on philosophical things are very engaging to me.</p></div>
  <div class="column" style="background-color:#ccc;"><h3>Gabe Brickner</h3>
  <img src="images/Gabe.jpg">
  <p>I am looking forward to progressing my skills with web design during my time in GIMM 300.
I dont have very much experience with HTML or CSS but I am hoping I can learn some cool ways to
design a website using CSS. I am also excited to start learning AWS because it is used in alot of development in tech based companies.</p></div>
